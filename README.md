# Social-proof_page
An assignment given by my coach at HerTechtrail from Frontend mentor

The challenge was to replicate the design and make it responsive

I built this with Html and CSS

This project is the most consistent i have been since i started coding, i really focused on media queries even if i'm not as good yet but i'm really happy i gave it a shot 

I'm definitely going to focus more on Responsiveness because i still have a lot of learning to do. hopefully, i improve in coming projects

#FOR CONTEXT:

Your challenge is to build out this social proof section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Download the zipped file attached, extract it and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project. The style-guide.md file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc. There is a design folder that provides the view of the page. (Use media queries to make your page responsive).
