# Social-proof_page
An assignment given by my coach at HerTechtrail from Frontend mentor

The challenge was to replicate the design and make it responsive

I built this with Html and CSS

This project is the most consistent i have been since i started coding, i really focused on media queries even if i'm not as good yet but i'm really happy i gave it a shot 

I'm definitely going to focus more on Responsiveness because i still have a lot of learning to do. hopefully, i improve in coming projects
